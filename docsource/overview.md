## Overview

The Alteon Load Balancer Universal Orchestrator extension is a plugin designed to facilitate the management of cryptographic certificates on Alteon Load Balancer platforms via Keyfactor Command. By leveraging this extension, organizations can streamline the inventory, addition, and removal of certificates within their Alteon Load Balancer environment.

Load balancers such as Alteon play a crucial role in distributing network traffic to ensure reliability and performance of applications. They terminate SSL/TLS connections, decrypting requests before forwarding them to backend servers. Managing certificates is thus essential to maintain secure communications, and this extension helps automate and simplify these tasks.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the for Alteon Load Balancer Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.



## AlteonLB Certificate Store Type

To use the for Alteon Load Balancer Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the AlteonLB Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.








#### Supported Operations

| Operation    | Is Supported                                                                                                           |

| Reenrollment | ðŸ”² Unchecked |
| Create       | ðŸ”² Unchecked     |

#### Store Type Creation

##### Using kfutil:
`kfutil` is a custom CLI for the Keyfactor Command API and can be used to create certificate store types.
For more information on [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil) check out the [docs](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)
   <details><summary>Click to expand AlteonLB kfutil details</summary>

   ##### Using online definition from GitHub:
   This will reach out to GitHub and pull the latest store-type definition
   ```shell
   # Alteon Load Balancer
   kfutil store-types create AlteonLB
   ```

   ##### Offline creation using integration-manifest file:
   If required, it is possible to create store types from the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) included in this repo.
   You would first download the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) and then run the following command
   in your offline environment.
   ```shell
   kfutil store-types create --from-file integration-manifest.json
   ```
   </details>


#### Manual Creation
Below are instructions on how to create the AlteonLB store type manually in
the Keyfactor Command Portal
   <details><summary>Click to expand manual AlteonLB details</summary>

   Create a store type called `AlteonLB` with the attributes in the tables below:

   ##### Basic Tab
   | Attribute | Value | Description |
   | --------- | ----- | ----- |
   | Name | Alteon Load Balancer | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
   | Short Name | AlteonLB | Short display name for the store type |
   | Capability | AlteonLB | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
   | Supports Add | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
   | Supports Remove | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
   | Supports Discovery | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
   | Supports Reenrollment | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
   | Supports Create | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
   | Needs Server | âœ… Checked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
   | Blueprint Allowed | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
   | Uses PowerShell | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
   | Requires Store Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
   | Supports Entry Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

   The Basic tab should look like this:

   ![AlteonLB Basic Tab](docsource/images/AlteonLB-basic-store-type-dialog.png)

   ##### Advanced Tab
   | Attribute | Value | Description |
   | --------- | ----- | ----- |
   | Supports Custom Alias | Optional | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
   | Private Key Handling | Optional | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. Required because IIS certificates without private keys would be invalid. |
   | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

   The Advanced tab should look like this:

   ![AlteonLB Advanced Tab](docsource/images/AlteonLB-advanced-store-type-dialog.png)

   > For Keyfactor **Command versions 24.4 and later**, a Certificate Format dropdown is available with PFX and PEM options. Ensure that **PFX** is selected, as this determines the format of new and renewed certificates sent to the Orchestrator during a Management job. Currently, all Keyfactor-supported Orchestrator extensions support only PFX.

   ##### Custom Fields Tab
   Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

   | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
   | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
   | ServerUsername | Server Username | Alteon user ID with sufficient permissions to manage certs in the Alteon Load Balancer. | Secret |  | âœ… Checked |
   | ServerPassword | Server Password | Password associated with Alteon user ID entered above. | Secret |  | âœ… Checked |

   The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

   ![AlteonLB Custom Fields Tab](docsource/images/AlteonLB-custom-fields-store-type-dialog.png)
